## How It Works

1. **Enter YouTube Playlist URL** - Paste the URL of the YouTube playlist you want to transfer
2. **Select Platform** - Choose your destination music platform (Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music)
3. **Authenticate** - Connect with your chosen platform (requires API credentials)
4. **Transfer** - The app will match songs and create your playlist on the selected platform

## PWA Features

- **Installable**: Can be installed on mobile and desktop devices
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality works offline
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for quick loading times
- **App-like Experience**: Full-screen mode and native feel

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] YouTube API integration for fetching playlist data
- [ ] Spotify API integration for creating playlists
- [ ] Apple Music API integration
- [ ] Amazon Music API integration
- [ ] Batch playlist transfers
- [ ] Playlist editing before transfer
- [ ] Track matching algorithm improvements
- [ ] Transfer history and analytics
- [ ] Reverse transfer (from streaming to YouTube)

## API Configuration

To fully implement the transfer functionality, you'll need API credentials:

- **YouTube Data API v3**: For fetching playlist information
- **Spotify Web API**: For creating playlists on Spotify
- **Apple Music API**: For Apple Music integration
- **Amazon Music API**: For Amazon Music integration

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
APPLE_MUSIC_KEY=your_apple_music_key
AMAZON_MUSIC_KEY=your_amazon_music_key
```
